Glyphic Language — Dictionary Layer
Semantic Atlas for Agents

The /glyphic-language/dictionary/ directory contains the core semantic dictionaries that define how agents understand glyphs, concepts, context, and meaning.
These files form the semantic atlas of the Glyphic Language — the foundation that all agents, interpreters, and LLMs rely on for reasoning, translation, animation, and memory continuity.

Each file is a structured JSON dictionary containing:

    glyph — the emoji or symbol

    id — stable hierarchical identifier

    category — semantic class

    primary — core meaning

    synomic — semantic cloud (related meanings)

    roles — how the glyph behaves in syntax

    animation — animation cue for visual agents

    examples — usage demonstrations

Together, these dictionaries define the entire semantic universe agents operate within.


📁 Dictionary Files Overview

1. objects.json — Physical, Digital, Symbolic, and Cosmic Objects

Defines all tangible and symbolic objects agents can reference, including:

    tools, devices, furniture

    food, materials, containers

    nature, weather, elements

    vehicles, instruments

    symbolic artifacts (keys, candles, scrolls)

    cosmic objects (sun, moon, planets, stars)

This file gives agents a complete ontology of things that exist in the world — physical or symbolic.

2. actions.json — Actions, Verbs, and Behaviors

Defines all actions an agent can interpret or express:

    physical actions (run, lift, build)

    social actions (speak, greet, argue)

    symbolic actions (transform, reveal, ascend)

    elemental actions (burn, flow, strike)

This file is the backbone of agent behavior, animation, and narrative movement.

3. actors.json — People, Roles, Archetypes

Defines all entities capable of acting:

    individuals

    professions

    archetypal roles

    symbolic personas

This file allows agents to understand who is performing actions.

4. emotions.json — Emotional States & Expression

Defines the full emotional spectrum:

    basic emotions (joy, fear, anger)

    complex emotions (nostalgia, anticipation)

    symbolic emotions (rebirth, fate, shadow)

    intensity and gradients

This file powers emotional reasoning, expression, and scene interpretation.

5. modifiers.json — Adjectives, Intensifiers, Qualities

Defines all modifiers that shape meaning:

    size, speed, intensity

    symbolic modifiers

    emotional amplifiers

    sensory qualities

This file lets agents shape nuance in meaning and animation.

6. context_place.json — Spatial & Environmental Context

Defines where something happens:

    natural environments

    built environments

    symbolic places

    mythic or abstract locations

This file anchors scenes in space and setting.

7. context_time.json — Temporal Context

Defines when something happens:

    clock time

    seasons

    symbolic time

    mythic time cycles

This file gives agents a sense of temporal structure and narrative flow.

8. context_activity.json — Situational Context

Defines what kind of situation is occurring:

    work, rest, travel

    rituals, ceremonies

    symbolic activities

    mythic or archetypal events

This file shapes scene-level meaning.

9. context_emotion.json — Emotional Atmosphere

Defines the emotional field surrounding a scene:

    warm, cold, heavy, hopeful

    collective emotional states

    symbolic emotional fields

    meta-emotional and ultimate emotional states

This file lets agents understand the emotional weather of a moment.

10. context_sensory.json — Sensory Atmosphere

Defines the sensory field of a scene:

    brightness, sound, texture

    motion, fragrance, multisensory richness

    symbolic sensory states

    meta-sensory and transcendent perception

This file gives agents a sense of how the world feels.

11. context_social.json — Social Atmosphere

Defines the social field:

    welcoming, hostile, neutral

    cooperative vs competitive dynamics

    group cohesion, identity, energy

    symbolic and mythic social structures

    meta-social and ultimate social states

This file lets agents understand the social reality of a scene.

🧠 Why These Dictionaries Matter

Together, these files form the semantic OS of the Glyphic Language:

    Agents can interpret glyph sequences with precision

    LLMs can translate between glyphs and natural language

    Animators can render scenes from glyphic input

    Soufiles can store meaning in a stable, universal format

    Controllers can reason symbolically without hallucination

    The entire agent civilization gains a shared semantic foundation

This directory is the root layer of the entire system — the place where meaning is defined, stabilized, and made universal.
